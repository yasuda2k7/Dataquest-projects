    "# Analyzing eBay Kleinanzeigen Used Car Sales\n",
    "eBay Kleinanzeigen is a [classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website and in this project we will be exploring its data of used car sales.  More specifically, we will clean the original dataset and then perform an analysis of it.  We will also become familiar with some of the unique benefits jupyter notebook provides for pandas.  \n",

    "The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle.  It can be found [here](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data) along with a summary and data dictionary.  We will be working with a modified, more raw version of it to practice data cleaning.\n",

    "## Summary of Findings and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Changed column names from camelcase to snakecase and renamed a handful to be more descriptive  \n",
    "2. Used the `info()` and `describe()` functions for summaries of dataframe and to see what to clean  \n",
    "3. Converted a couple columns (`price` and `odometer`) from string to numeric and removed a few colummns that do not provide useful infomation  \n",
    "4. Removed rows that contain outlier data (e.g. invalid registration dates and unrealistic prices)  \n",
    "5. Explored frequency distributions of various date columns, specifically `date_crawled`, `ad_created`, and `last_seen`  \n",
    "    * We used the `value_counts()` and `sort_index` to show this information\n",
    "6. Analyzed average price and average kilometers for the most common used car brands  \n",
    "    * We created a single pandas dataframe with two pandas series (from two dictionaries) to easily illustrate this information"
