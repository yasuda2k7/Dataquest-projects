    "**Description:** [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a website by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (also known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments, similar to Reddit.  It is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the listing can get hundreds of thousands of views.  \n",

    "We are specifically interested in the posts with titles that begin with `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.  `Ask HN` posts are those where specific questions are asked to the Hacker News community.  `Show HN` posts are those where projects, products, or anything else interesting is shared with the Hacker News community.\n",

    "We will work with the dataset described below to answer two questions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments (on average)?\n",
    "2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments (on average)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** The dataset consists of information related to submissions (posts) to Hacker News.  It was originally ~300,000 rows, but it got reduced to ~20,000 rows after removing all submissions that did not receive any comments and further randomly sampling the remaining submissions.  There are 7 fields (columns) in total, and examples include `id`, `num_points`, `num_comments`, and `created_at`.  More details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts)."

    "* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments (on average)?  \n",
    "    *Answer*: We found that on average, `Ask HN` posts receive  ~10 comments per post, wheras `Show HN` posts receive about half of that (around 5 comments per post).  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Do `Ask HN` posts created at a certain time receive more comments (on average)?  \n",
    "    *Answer*: We found that afternoons are when `Ask HN` posts receive the most comments, on average.  Specifically, the average number of comments per post between 3pm and 4pm EST is 29, and the average number of comments per post between 1pm and 2pm EST is 16.  The remaining hours in the day have less than 12 comments per post (again, on average)."
