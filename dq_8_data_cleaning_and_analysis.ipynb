    "# Analysis of the Survey Results of Star Wars Fans\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project we explore, clean, and analyze the survey results of Star Wars fans.  It includes a total of 835 responses to various questions such as age, gender, household income, education, location, whether or not they saw certain movies, and how they rank each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "* The fifth Star Wars movie was the highest ranked, on average, by all survey responders\n",
    "    - Followed by the sixth and fourth Star Wars movie\n",
    "* The fifth Star Wars movie was watched the most by all survey responders\n",
    "    - Followed by the sixth and fourth Star Wars movie\n",
    "* The fifth Star Wars movie was the highest ranked, on average, by all Male survey responders\n",
    "    - It was also watched the most by all Male survey responders\n",
    "* The fifth Star Wars movie was the highest ranked, on average, by all female survey responders\n",
    "    - It was also watched the most by all female survey responders\n",
    "* Female survey responders ranked the first, fourth, and sixth Star Wars movies higher than Male survey responders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used the `value_counts()` function to look at frequency distributions of the values in columns\n",
    "* Used the `map()` function to convert \"Yes/No\" string values to True/False boolean values\n",
    "* Used the `rename()` function set set more intuitive column names\n",
    "* Used the `astype()` function to change data from string to boolean type\n",
    "* Used `mean()` and `sum()` functions to summarize the data\n",
    "* Used `plt.bar()` to plot bar graphs of summarized data\n",
    "* Used boolean masking to get subsets of the data (e.g. Male/Female)"
