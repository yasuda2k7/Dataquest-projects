    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** In this hypothetical scenario, a medical institute is building a mobile app to help lottery addicts understand their extremely low chances of winning.  The goal is for addicted gamblers and *potential* addicted gamblers to use the app in hopes of treating and preventing their toxic tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Our task is to develop the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.  The first version's focus is around the following questions:\n",
    "* What is the probability/chance of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability/chance of winning the big prize if 40 different tickets are played?  How about any other number of tickets?\n",
    "* What is the probability/chance of having at least five, four, three, or two winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** We will be utilizing fictional historical data from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada.  The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has 3,665 drawings from the years 1982-2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lottery:** In the 6/49 lottery, 6 numbers are drawn *without replacement* from a set of 49 numbers (ranging from 1 to 49).  To answer probability questions related to playing the lottery, we'll need to repeatedly calculate `factorials` and `combinations`.  They are defined as functions in the cell below."
