# Dataquest-projects
This is where all my Dataquest projects will be stored.

## A note on naming conventions
At the beginning my Dataquest journey, I named my notebooks like "dq_(number)_...", but later realized they weren't very descriptive.
After project 10, I began giving them more detailed names, which describes why the naming conventions suddenly changed.  
  
I hope this helps my future self and anyone else looking at these.  Thanks!
